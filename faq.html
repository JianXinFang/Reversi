                <td>Reversi is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. 
            There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. 
            Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up.</td>

                    You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces, is flanked by your pieces. 
                    All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color. </td>
